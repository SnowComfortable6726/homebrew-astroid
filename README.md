This is a Mac OS Homebrew Tap (third party repository) for [astroidmail](http://astroidmail.github.io/) on OSX.

Once you have [Homebrew running](https://brew.sh/), it should be as easy as:
```
$ brew tap astroidmail/astroid
```

You can then install with
```
$ brew install astroid
```
which will also build a special webkit dependency. This can take a while.
