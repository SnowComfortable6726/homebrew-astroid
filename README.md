This is a Mac OS Homebrew Tap (third party repository) for [astroidmail](http://astroidmail.github.io/) on OSX.

Once you have [Homebrew running](https://brew.sh/), it should be as easy as:
```
$ brew tap astroidmail/astroid
```

You can then install with
```
$ brew install astroid [--HEAD]
```
which will also pull down a webkit dependency as a bottle. If you choose `--build-from-source` then you will have to wait a long time to compile, and you may have some issues we won't support :)
